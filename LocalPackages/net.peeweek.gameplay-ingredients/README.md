<u>You can read Documentation at this address :</u> [https://peeweek.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gameplay-ingredients/](https://peeweek.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gameplay-ingredients/)

## Requirements

* **Unity 2019.3** (Older versions compatible with 2018.3 / 2019.1 / 2019.2)
* Package Manager UI
* (**Optional** : Command-line Git installed on your system, for example [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))

## How to install

You can use a manual, local package installation if you need to alter the code locally or update the code base regularly. 

Otherwise, you can perform a git referenced package in your `manifset.json` file : this option shall download and manage automatically the repository, with the drawback of being read-only.

### Manual Version

- Clone this repository somewhere of your liking
- In your project, open the `Window/Package Manager` window and use the + button to select the `Add Package from Disk...` option.
- Navigate to your repository folder and select the `package.json` file
- The package shall be added as a **local package**

### Git reference version

- Ensure you have a **[Command Line Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) Installed**
- With Unity 2019.3 closed, edit the `Packages/manifest.json` with a text editor
- Append the line `    "net.peeweek.gameplay-ingredients": "https://github.com/peeweek/net.peeweek.gameplay-ingredients.git#2019.3.0",` under `dependencies`

You can check that the package was imported by looking at the project window, under Packages/ Hierarchy, there should be a `Gameplay Ingredients` hierarchy
